Logistic Regression - Problem statement

Agenda:

Using logistic regression you predict whether a passenger is alive or not.

Inference to be shown:

You have more than one feature here, and If the value of the model predicts 0.79, that would mean a person is 79% alive and 21% dead.

Intermediate steps involved:

Countplot for survived vs sex
Find out the number of missing values
Boxplot for P-class and age
Heatmap to check for null values.
